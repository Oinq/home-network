Initial system setup completed. Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS installed and fully updated, using UEFI boot with separate `/boot` and `/boot/efi` partitions and an LVM layout (100 GB root, ~362 GB free for future volumes).

Hostname set to **erebor**.

Automatic security updates enabled via `unattended-upgrades`.

Base administration tools installed and verified: htop, lm-sensors, smartmontools, nvme-cli, iotop, iftop, ncdu, curl, wget, git, unzip.

Hardware validated (CPU, RAM, storage, sensors) with no kernel or hardware errors detected.

Basic local monitoring configured using Glances.

The system is now stable and ready for the next phase: installing the SAS HBA and adding the 12-disk storage subsystem.

Se quiseres, também posso formatar isto como `README.md` mais estruturado (com títulos, secções, etc.).
Tens razão — aquilo ficou tudo “colado”. Aqui vai com **quebras de linha próprias para GitHub (Markdown)**:

The system is now stable and ready for the next phase: installing the SAS HBA and adding the 12-disk storage subsystem.

Glances monitoring was configured as a persistent systemd service,
bound to 0.0.0.0 and exposed to the local network.

The Home Assistant Glances integration was successfully connected
and is now ingesting live system metrics (CPU, memory, disks, temperatures, network, uptime, etc.).

The service is enabled at boot and verified operational after restart.

This establishes a functional monitoring baseline for the server,
ready for future expansion (alerts, dashboards, Prometheus/Grafana, filtering).

Minecraft server successfully migrated to the new host (erebor) using Docker.
Data was transferred via rsync into the new persistent directory under /srv/docker-data/minecraft.
Docker Engine and Docker Compose (plugin) were installed from the official Docker repository.
A fresh docker-compose.yml was created and the container (itzg/minecraft-server) started cleanly.
The container was validated through logs and health checks, and confirmed to restart correctly after reconnecting SSH.
This confirms that Docker, persistence, and service reliability are working correctly on the new system, independent of the RAID subsystem.
