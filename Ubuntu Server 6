Home server in early setup stage, installed with Ubuntu Server on dedicated hardware with a 500 GB SSD.

The system uses UEFI with separate `/boot` and `/boot/efi` partitions, and LVM to allow flexible storage management.

Base hardware:
MSI Z97-G45 Gaming motherboard
Intel i7-4790K CPU
24 GB RAM
EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3
LSI 9207-8i PCIe card
12 bay, 3.5" HDD chassis

The root partition (`/`) is 100 GB, and the remaining **362 GB** is reserved for future data volumes and services (e.g. Docker, storage, VMs).

This repository documents the configuration process, technical decisions, and ongoing evolution of the server.
